Gibbs
=====

A package written in R for the estimation of parameters in a regime switching auto-regressive process using the method
of Gibbs sampling.

The source code file is "gibbs.r"

The files listed "simulation-1.R" etc are R workspace files that can be loaded using the "load" command. They contain
simulation data that were genderated from the above file and stored. These are the same data files that were used in
the report, which can be found on my Academia.edu page
